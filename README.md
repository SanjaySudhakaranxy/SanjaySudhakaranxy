## Hey there! I'm Sanjay Sudhakaran.
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

## What I Do:
Iâ€™m constantly learning and pushing my boundariesâ€”whether itâ€™s web development, data science, machine learning, or building cool apps. This is where I dump everything I learn, so youâ€™ll find a mix of fun projects, experimental code, and everything in between. Itâ€™s not about being perfectâ€”itâ€™s about progress.ðŸŒ±

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here:
- **Learning Projects**: Code dumps of everything I pick upâ€”think of it as a learning playground.
- **Side Projects**: Little experiments to improve my skills and test new concepts.
- **Collaboration**: Feel free to contribute, fork, or open issuesâ€”let's make some cool stuff together!
- 
##  What I'm Currently Exploring:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- **Web Dev**: React, Node.js, CSS, HTML
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Git, APIs, SQL, etc.

Feel free to follow me and drop a if something inspires you! Also, if you see something interesting or could improve my code, donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue or pull requestâ€”let's make it better together! <3
